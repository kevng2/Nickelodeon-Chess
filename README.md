Chess but with Nickelodeon Characters
</br>
Description: Nickelodeon Chess is just a simple chess game with a Nickelodeon flavor to it. The goal is to restrict the movement of chess pieces based on a set of allowed moves like in other chess programs.
</br>
Details About Interface: To move a piece, click on the piece and then click on the square you want to move it to.
</br>
Libraries: Pygame- used for creating the board and adding sprites
           sound-used for playing the music
           tkinter - used for the GUI
</br>
Issues: Currently after capturing a move you have to click off the board for the board to update.
        Currently the game does not implement a check and checkmate function
